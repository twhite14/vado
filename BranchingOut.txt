Must Read !

Okay after some serious experimenting I figured out gitHub. 

Toms steps he gave are fine but I learned from more experienced people than ourselves 
That any time we want to make an adjustment to the project to follow these steps

1. Make a new branch so you don’t mess with the master branch.
 
2. Make whatever changes you need to make in YOUR BRANCH.
 
3. Merge the branch with the master branch.
 
4. Bam! you changed whatever it was.

Then add commit push is useful however, if you are changing a file you must use branches so you do not
alter the only working file we have in the git. 

Also my latest commit "hopefully this helps" is the whole project so work out of that file.
