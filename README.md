This repo contains the works of multiple partners as part of a project at HackPSU 2015.
The project incorporated the PSU clubs database into a desktop and mobile application that would allow students to more easily access the organizations they may be interested in.

So far, an android app has been developed that demonstrates the concept. It currently uses a single .csv file as its database but would link to a SQL database in the future.

This project is not complete and was created in cooperation with several Penn State students in the course of 24 hours. Look into code at your own risk.
